== Special object names ==

solid_* - regions that have solid colors
marker_* - special points on the object
    (the average is taken of all the points that compose the marker)


== Exporting to OBJ in blender ==

* Select "Triangulate Faces"
* Set "Forward:" to "Y forward"
** Doing this should set "Up:" to "Z up"
** This makes the coordinates in the OBJ file match the ones seen in Blender
